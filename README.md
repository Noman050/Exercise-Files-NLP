# NLP and Speech Processing Exercises

Welcome to this comprehensive repository of natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing exercises! This collection of Jupyter notebooks provides practical and step-by-step demonstrations of NLP and speech processing techniques. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, these exercises cover a wide range of essential topics.

## üåü Key Features

- **Text Processing**: Learn and apply text preprocessing, feature extraction, and embedding techniques using libraries like NLTK, Scikit-learn, spaCy, Gensim, and Sentence Transformers.
- **Speech Processing**: Explore audio feature extraction methods and embeddings with Librosa and the Wav2Vec model from the Transformers library.
- **Text Classification & Clustering**: Understand and implement SVM classification, K-means clustering, POS tagging, and syntactic parsing for diverse NLP applications.
- **Advanced NLP Models**: Experiment with modern NLP models, including RNNs for text generation, and Wav2Vec for speech-to-text conversion, alongside Tacotron and WaveGlow for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis.
